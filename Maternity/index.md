## Course content

Please view these modules on a laptop, desktop or tablet device. The resolution of the screen recorded modules is fixed and not well suited to smaller mobile device screens.

All modules are interactive, requiring eLearners to click or type on screen, to complete the module.

Completion of each module is reported to the LMS once the "summary" slide of each module is reached.

2. [Missing pregnancy information](/02/story.html)

## Integration with LMS

Each module is a [SCORM](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/) (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) package. It can be used with any [LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) (Learning Management System) that supports version SCORM 1.2. SCORM modules are exported from [Articulate Storyline 360](https://www.articulate.com/360/storyline/) in ZIP format.

When run from an LMS, the SCORM reports these data to the LMS:

* `cmi.core.score.raw` – a number from 0 to 100 for the overall score
* `cmi.core.score.min` – 0
* `cmi.core.score.max` – 100
* `cmi.core.lesson_status` – 'completed' or 'incomplete'
