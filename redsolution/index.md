## About

This project was a final year undergraduate university assessment, for the subject _Online documentary_. It was completed as a group project, with four members, in October 2019.

The documentary was created using [Tumult Hype](https://tumult.com/hype/), a HTML5 creation app for macOS.

_The Re(d)solution_ interactive documentary is designed to increase awareness of blood donation in Australia and motivate potential new donors to donate their blood. It seeks to achieve this through a quiz dispelling some prevalent myths about blood donation, as well as interviews with current blood donors, blood recipients and vox pops as an indicator of public attitudes towards blood donation. It concludes by urging its audience to ‘get involved’ and refers viewers to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service to book a blood donation appointment. The project was motivated by two group members’ personal interest in blood donation.
