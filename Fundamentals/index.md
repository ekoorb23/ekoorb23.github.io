## Integration with LMS

Each module is a [SCORM](https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/) (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) package. It can be used with any [LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) (Learning Management System) that supports SCORM version 1.2. SCORM modules are exported from [Articulate Storyline 360](https://www.articulate.com/360/storyline/) in ZIP format.

When run from an LMS, the SCORM reports these data to the LMS:

* `cmi.core.score.raw` – a number from 0 to 100 for the overall score
* `cmi.core.score.min` – 0
* `cmi.core.score.max` – 100
* `cmi.core.lesson_status` – 'completed' or 'incomplete'
